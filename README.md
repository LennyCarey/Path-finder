# Python Path Finder
**Overview**
This project implements a path-finding algorithm in Python. It aims to find the shortest path between two points on a grid using A* path finding visualization.

**Features**
 - Implementations of A* path-finding algorithms
 - Visualization of pathfinding results
 - Support for various grid sizes and obstacles


**Algorithms**
The project currently supports the following path-finding algorithms:

- A (A-star):* A heuristic-based algorithm that finds the shortest path efficiently.
